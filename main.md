## Welcome to RAYYAN PROJECT!

This project includes a Python script that provides a console-based interface with the following functionalities:

1. A command cheat sheet for Linux commands.
2. A function to attempt 'decrypting' SHA-512 hashes using a dictionary attack.
3. A basic subdomain finder for a given domain.

### How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. Then, run the script using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaliafridi/Multiple-Purpose-Tool.git
cd Multiple-Purpose-Tool
python3 MultiplePurposeTool.py
